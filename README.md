# Artificial Neural Networks – Learning Notes

This repository contains my learning and practice notebook for Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using TensorFlow/Keras.

This is a learning-focused repository, not a production-ready project.

## Concepts Covered
- Data preprocessing for neural networks
- One-hot encoding
- Feature scaling
- Train-test split
- ANN using Keras Sequential API
- Hidden layers & activation functions
- Dropout regularization
- Binary classification
- Early stopping
- Model evaluation & visualization

## Dataset
Customer Churn dataset (publicly available)

## Files
- `ANN_Learning_Notes.ipynb` – Main learning notebook

## Observations
- Accuracy alone was misleading due to class imbalance.
- The confusion matrix showed bias toward the majority class.
- This reinforced the importance of deeper evaluation metrics.

## Future Improvements
- Handle class imbalance
- Tune hyperparameters
- Add ROC-AUC and precision-recall curves
